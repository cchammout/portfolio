## SQL Project: Data Management 
I was tasked with creating a business report where I analyzed a dataset from a movie rental database using SQL. I asked pertinent business questions that I then built my code around for the analysis. I chose to base the project around which movie categories were the most and least popular. I then created new tables housing the information needed and scheduled a job to update my tables whenever the data set updated. Below you'll find a link to the .doc file with said business report and the code I wrote:
