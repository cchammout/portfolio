## SQL Project: Data Management 
I was tasked with creating a business report where I analyzed a dataset from a movie rental database using SQL. I asked pertinent business questions that I then built my code around for the analysis. I chose to base the project around which movie categories were the most and least popular. I then created new tables housing the information needed and scheduled a job to update my tables whenever the data set updated. Below you'll find a link to the .doc file with said business report and the code I wrote:

## PostgreSQL: Data Modeling 
Using a fictious music streaming platform's data set, I was tasked with creating a database schema and ETL pipeline. The readme file in the link below will provide more in depth discussion on the particular processes utilized.

## Python: A/B Test 
I was tasked with working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Below is a link to the .pdf of the project.

## Python: Data Wrangling, Cleaning, and Visualization 
I was tasked with wrangling data from the WeRateDogs twitter archives, cleaning it, storing it for analysis, and utilizing for visualization purposes. Below a link can be found with several .pdf files. One containing the jupyter notebook with the code and work, one with a write up on how I completed the task, and the last one in the style of a blog post to report my findings.

## R: Analysis of Bikeshare Data 
Given data sets from three different cities from a bike share company I asked three business questions. I used R to analyze the data and create visualizations. Below is a link to the .pdf file.
